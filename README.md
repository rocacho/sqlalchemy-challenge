Module 10 Challenge
To visualize the tables in the sqlite database i used https://sqliteviewer.app/#/hawaii.sqlite/table/station/
To solve the Flask API I based mostly in the Titanic App example form the class
Whithin the Resources file I added a coppy of the app.py file with a route for the sqlite hawaii file (sqlite:///hawaii.sqlite) to be at the same level, because it was not reading it form outside the resources file with this route (sqlite:///Resources/hawaii.sqlite)
